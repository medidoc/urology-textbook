<h1>Radikale Zystektomie: Surgical Technique (Step-by-Step) and Complications</h1>

<h2>Indications for Cystectomy</h2>

<h3>Radical Cystectomy:</h3>
<p>Radical cystectomy is the resection of the urinary bladder with a safety margin and pelvic lymphadenectomy. In addition, the prostate is also removed in men. In women, a segment of the anterior vaginal wall, uterus, and optionally the ovaries are removed. Indications for radical cystectomy are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Muscle-invasive bladder carcinoma without distant metastases</li>
    <li>Superficial high-grade urinary bladder carcinoma with high risk of progression [Tab. \ref{harnblasenkarzinom_progression1} and \ref{harnblasenkarzinom_progression2}] in young patients (early elective cystectomy)</li>
    <li>Recurrent superficial high-grade bladder carcinoma</li>
    <li>Endoscopically uncontrollable superficial bladder carcinoma</li>
    <li>Palliative cystectomy for advanced bladder carcinoma and refractory bleeding, fistulae or lack of bladder capacity with pollakiuria</li>
</ul>

<h3>Simple Cystectomy:</h3>
<p>Simple cystectomy is the resection of the urinary bladder without safety margin and without pelvic lymphadenectomy. In men, comparable to simple prostatectomy, the prostatic capsule is left in situ to improve continence and potency after orthotopic urinary diversion. In women, the internal genital organs are spared. Indications for simple cystectomy are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Lack of bladder capacity after radiotherapy, tuberculosis, schistosomiasis or interstitial cystitis.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Contraindications of Cystectomy</h2>
<p>Untreated coagulation disorders. The other contraindications depend on the surgical risk due to the patient's comorbidity, and the surgical procedure's impact on the patient's life expectancy and quality of life.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Surgical Technique of Cystectomy</h2>

<h3>Preoperative patient preparation:</h3> 

<ul>
    <li>Stoma counseling and preoperative stoma site marking, even if orthotopic neobladder is anticipated.</li> 
    <li>Exclude or treat <a href="urinary-tract-infection.html">urinary tract infection</a>. </li>
    <li>Bowel preparation depends on the <a href="urinary-diversion.html">planned urinary diversion</a></li>
    <li><a href="perioperative-antibiotic-prophylaxis.html">Perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis</a>: cephalosporin combined with metronidazole, alternatively gentamicin combined with metronidazole or aminopenicillin with penicillinase inhibitor combined with metronidazole.</li>
    <li>Anesthesia: the combination of an epidural with general anesthesia lowers intraoperative and postoperative opiate requirements, reduces intraoperative bleeding, and accelerates postoperative gastrointestinal recovery (Ozyuvaci et al., 2005). </li>
    <li>Perioperative gastric tube.</li>
    <li>Patient positioning: supine position with slight hyperextension of the lumbar spine and slight abduction of the legs. Skin desinfectino from nipples to midthighs. Draping with access to the external genitals, insert a 22 CH catheter with 30~ml balloon inflation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Surgical Approach for Cystectomy</h3>

<p><a href="midline-laparotomy.html">Lower midline laparotomy</a> from symphysis to umbilicus, if necessary extend the incision to the left of the umbilicus. The retropubic space is developed bluntly. Open the peritoneal cavity near the umbilicus, expose the urachus and divide between ligatures. The peritoneum is incised on both sides of the urinary bladder. Examine of the <a href="abdominal-cavity-anatomy-muscles.html">abdominal cavity</a> for metastases. Perform a right lateralocolic incision and circumferential incision of the caecum for complete mobilization of the right colon. Identify the right ureter. Perform a left lateralocolic incision to mobilize the sigmoid colon. Identify the left ureter. For good exposure of the pelvic cavity, the bowel is packed into the upper abdomen with moist and warm laparotomy towels and using a retraction system.</p>

<h3>Pelvic lymphadenectomy:</h3>
<p>The parietal peritoneum is incised along the external iliac artery and both vasa deferentia are transected. Pelvic lymphadenectomy is performed on both sides: the dissection borders for standard lymphadenectomy are laterally the genitofemoral nerve, caudally the superior ramus of the os pubis, medially the umbilical ligament and the urinary bladder, dorsally the obturator nerve and the pelvic diaphragm, cranially the ureter and the bifurcation of the common iliac artery [fig. <a href="#Gray_Gefaesse_innerer_Leistenring_innen">pelvic lymphadenectomy</a>]. The iliac vessels are freed from the surrounding lymphatic tissue in a circular fashion. During this procedure, the first branches from the internal iliac artery (superior vesical artery and the umbilical artery) are divided and ligated. A careful dissection technique with bipolar coagulation, application of clips and thin ligatures reduces the complication rate due to lymphoceles.</p>

<p>For extended lymphadenectomy, the lymphatic tissue along the vasa iliaca communis to the aorta are also removed. Data from retrospective studies speculated better tumor-free survival by extended lymphadenectomy, but statistical flaws (Will Rogers phenomenon) make evaluation difficult. One prospective randomized trial could not demonstrate better survival by extended lymphadenectomy (Gschwend et al., 2019a), further studies (S-1011) are expected.</p>

<h3>Dissection of the ureters:</h3>
<p>The ureters are transected near the bladder and the distal portion is sent for frozen sectioning. The ureters are splinted with MJ ureteral stents (secured with 4-0 fast absorbing sutures), this allows atraumatic management of the ureters during the next steps. The ureters are dissected as little as possible to maintain their blood supply (caution: ureteral stricture).</p> 

<h3>Division of the bladder pedicles:</h3>
<p>The peritoneal fold between the bladder and the rectum is incised at the deepest point across its entire width, and the layer between the rectum and the bladder is bluntly developed in the midline. The left hand can now be used to pull the urinary bladder anteriorly and caudally, the bladder pedicles with the vascular supply will become visible. The bladder pedicle is grasped between the index finger and middle finger of the left hand. Step by step, the right and left bladder pedicles are divided between clips, ligatures, GIA or vascular sealing devices. For a nerve-sparing cystectomy, the line of dissection must be close to the urinary bladder. Both seminal vesicles are exposed after transection of Denonvillier's fascia, and the layer between the rectum and prostate is bluntly developed. </p>

<h3>Ascending dissection of the prostate:</h3>
<p>The prostate (and urinary bladder) are retracted in dorso-cranial direction. The ventral prostate is cleared of fatty tissue, and interfering superficial veins are coagulated and cut between clips. The endopelvic fascia and puboprostatic ligaments are incised on both sides. The apex of the prostate is bluntly exposed with a dissecting swab.</p>
    <h4>Division of the dorsal vein complex:</h4> 
<p>The dorsal vein complex is grasped with a Babcock clamp over the prostate apex and a suture ligation is done. The venous plexus is gradually transected down to the urethra, and bleeding vessels are coagulated or sutured.</p> 
    <h4>Nerve-sparing:</h4>
<p>The fascia overlying the prostate is incised and the cavernosal nerves are swept laterally. An overholt clamp is used for dissection, and clips are used to stop bleeding from small vessels. The urethra is separated from the cavernous nerve bundle with a right-angle clamp and a strong ligature (USP 1--2) is passed around the urethra and tied close to the prostate apex to avoid tumor cell seeding after transection.</p>

    <h3>Division of the urethra:</h3>
<p>The ventral hemicircumference of the urethra is divided distal to the ligature until the catheter is visible. A piece of urethra is may be sent for a frozen section. At 9, 11, 1, and 3 o'clock, anastomotic sutures are placed if orthotopic urinary diversion is anticipated (double-armored suture such as PDS 2-0 or Vicryl 2-0 with 5/8 needle).</p>

<p>After clamping the bladder catheter in the opened urethra, the valve piece is cut of and the catheter is pulled into the pelvis. It serves as a mobilization aid for further dissection. Dissect the dorsal urethra and rectourethral muscle. Two anastomotic sutures are placed at 5 and 7 o'clock position of the urethra. The dorsal anastomotic sutures may additionally be passed through the dorsal external sphincter complex (or additional sutures), this should improve early continence and tightness of the anastomosis (Rocco et al., 2009).</p>

<p>The layer between the rectum and the prostate is now visualized by dissecting remnants of the external sphincter muscle and by blunt finger dissection. The cavernous nerve bundle is separated from the prostate with overholt dissection, vessels to the prostate are cut between clips.</p> 

    <h4>Dissection of seminal vesicles:</h4>

<p>The prostate is detached from the rectum until the seminal vesicles are visible, this is usually bluntly possible. Vessels to the seminal vesicles are cut between clips. If nerve-sparing is intended,  it is important to stay close to the seminal vesicles and urinary bladder. Avoid urine spilling during dissection and removal or the specimen. Careful irrigation and hemostasis is paramount after cystectomy: use figure-of-eight sutures and packing of the pelvic cavity during urinary division procedure.</p>

<h3>Urinary diversion:</h3>
<p>Please see section urinary diversion for the different options.</p>
