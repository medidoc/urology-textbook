<h1>TURP: Indications and Technique of Transurethral Resection of the Prostate</h1>


<p>Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is the endoscopic removal of prostate tissue using a electrified wire loop (Alschibaja et al., 2005). TURP is used to a maximum prostate gland size of 75&ndash;120 ml. Despite many endoscopic alternatives, TURP is the most commonly performed procedure for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)</p>

</ul><h2>Surgical Technique of the Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP)</h2>

<h3>Reducing the risk of bleeding</h3> <p>The bleeding during TURP may be reduced by a medication with <a href="https://www.urology-textbook.com/finasteride.html">finasteride</a> or <a href="https://www.urology-textbook.com/dutasteride.html">dutasteride</a>. The effect is based on the reduction of vessel density, but can only be expected after several months lasting therapy.</p>

<h3>Anesthesia for TURP</h3> <p>Spinal anesthesia or general anesthesia is recommended. The spinal anesthesia offers theoretical advantages in the initial postoperative period: the patient is immobilized, manipulations with the catheter are possible without pain and there is less pressing and coughing after surgery. Randomized studies have found no difference in bleeding volume. </p>

<h3>Perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis</h3> 

<p>Several randomized studies have found benefits for the administration of a perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis. Dosage: e.g., <a href="https://www.urology-textbook.com/ciprofloxacin.html">ciprofloxacin</a> 500&nbsp;mg p.o. 1-0-1. Patients with risk factors for a urinary tract infection (diabetes, bladder stones and preoperative bladder catheter) benefit especially from an antibiotic prophylaxis. A perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis reduces postoperative urinary tract infections, fever and may reduce the likelihood for urethral strictures.</p><h3>Preoperative Preparations</h3> <p>The patient is placed in <a href="https://www.urology-textbook.com/lithotomy-position.html">lithotomy position</a>. Suprapubic shaving.  Disinfection of the external genitalia, the lower abdomen and the perineum. Sterile draping with rectal shield.</p>

<h3>Cystoscopy</h3> <p>Check for the width of the urethra, prostate size and absence of bladder stones. A suprapubic bladder catheter with at least 14 CH size is inserted, to allow irrigation during the procedure. </p>

<h3>Internal Urethrotomy</h3> 

<p>24 CH instruments normally fit through the urethra without problems and should be used for resection of even large glands. Short distance urethral strictures are treated by <a href="https://www.urology-textbook.com/internal-urethrotomy.html">internal urethrotomy with direct vision</a>. However, if the anterior urethra is too narrow to accommodate the instrument, a perineal urethrostomy can be performed to insert the instrument. As an alternative, blind urethrotomy over the narrow segment of the urethra may be performed. With larger instruments (28 CH), prophylactic blind urethrotomy was recommended to prevent ischemic damage and consecutive urethral stricture. </p>

<h3>Resectoscope:</h3>
<p>A resectoscope is a combination of a cystoscope and electrosurgical instrument, which enables the resection of the prostate with an electrical activated wire loop [figure <a href="#resectoscope">resectoscope</a>]. Continuous irrigation is necessary for endoscopic vision impaired by the bleeding of the prostate during the procedure. In low pressure resection, the irrigation fluid is drained via a suprapubic trokar. Alternatively, a two-channel resectoscope can be used, one channel for irrigation and the other channel for the drainage. Disadvantages are however the diameter of the instrument and less reliable drainage of the irrigation fluid. .</p>

<h4>Electrocautery</h4> 

<p>Monopolar current is used in standard TURP, with different programs for cutting and coagulation, comparable to open surgery. The coagulation effect is produced by the current flow from the resection loop through the prostate tissue to the return electrode. The irrigation solution used in transurethral resection with monopolar current must be salt-free to prevent current flow through the irrigation fluid. The salt-free irrigation fluid harbors a risk for a TUR syndrome, if large amounts of fluid enter the circulation (see below).</p>

<caption><strong>Different resection electrodes (from right to left):</strong> standard wire loop, rollerball electrode, vaporization roller electrode, thick look vor vaporization, Collins knife electrode for TUIP or bladder neck incision.</caption>
</table>

<p>It is important to avoid unnecessarily high current power, as collateral damage on the sphincter of the urethra and at the N. cavernous otherwise become possible. The padding of the patient must be kept dry to prevent burns. <i>Bipolar resection</i> is a good alternative to monopolar TURP, for which normal saline irrigation solution can be used.</p>

<h4>Different wire loops and electrodes:</h4>

<p>Various wire loops and electrodes have been developed to improve cutting, coagulation and vaporization. Technical variations are thicker loops (band loop), rollerballs, groved vaporization roller or Collins knife electrodes  [figure <a href="#turp-electrodes">different resection electrodes</a>]. </p>


<h3>Resection Technique (<a href="#Mauermayer1985">Mauermayer, 1985</a>)</h3>

<p>First, the middle lobe is resected and an excavation between five and seven o'clock up to the surgical capsule is formed. After that, now with good irrigation speed made possible, the side lobes and ventral parts of the gland are resected. The apical parts of gland are resected last. [fig <a href="#TURP_Bilder">prostate resection (TURP)</a>].</p>

<h3>Apical Resection</h3> <p>The apical resection is the most important part for the success of the prostate resection. An insufficient apical resection does not remove the obstruction. On the other hand, the external sphincter of the bladder is in close anatomical proximity and may be injured by excessive apical resection. </p>

<p>The anatomical land mark for the apical resection is the seminal colliculus (verumontanum). The adenoma is removed preserving the verumontanum. The resection starts at the six o'clock position (with the verumontanum in sight) and is carried out in a circular manner. An unintentional slippage of the resectoscope during resection has to be avoided or damage to the sphincter can easily occur. This is especially true for the resection at the twelve o'clock position, as the verumontanum is not in sight.</p>

<h3>Removal of the Resection Chips</h3> 
<p>Using a bladder syringe or Ellik-Evacuator, all resection chips should be removed from the bladder. This instrument should be raised (stand up!), so that the shaft moves in the direction of the trigone of the bladder. The cystoscopic control of the complete removal avoids postoperative problems like catheter blockage, <a href="https://www.urology-textbook.com/urinary-retention.html">urinary retention</a> or chronic infections.  </p>

<h3>Continuous Irrigation Catheter</h3> 

<p>After the resection and removal of all resection chips, a 20&ndash;24 CH irrigation catheter is introduced. The balloon is inflated with at least 20 ml and is positioned in the prostatic fossa.  Venous bleeding can be controlled by increasing the balloon inflation (maximum additional 1 ml per 1 gram resected tissue). The bladder is an alternative position for the catheter balloon (50--80 ml balloon inflation). Bleeding is controlled with a slight traction on the catheter, which pulls the catheter balloon against the bladder neck. </p>

<h3>Postoperative Management after transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP)</h3>

<ul title="Postoperative management after TURP">
<li>Continuous irrigation for 12&ndash;24 h</li>
<li>Removal of the catheter after 2&ndash;3 days</li>
<li>Control of complete bladder emptying with help of the suprapubic catheter or by ultrasound imaging</li>
</ul>

<h2>Intraoperative Complications of TURP</h2>

<h3>Bleeding</h3> 

<p>Arterial bleeding should be stopped using electrocautery by the end of the operation. New arterial bleedings in the postoperative course require repeated endoscopic hemostasis.</p>

<p>Venous bleeding is often difficult to be stopped by electrocautery. Venous bleedings can be controlled with the catheter: the balloon is inflated with at least 20 ml and is positioned in the prostatic fossa. Venous bleeding can be controlled by increasing the balloon inflation (maximum additional 1 ml per 1 gram resected tissue) and/or by slight traction with the catheter. Alternatively, the catheter balloon is positioned in the bladder, inflated to 50&ndash;100 ml and pulled against the bladder neck with slight traction. </p>
<p>Bleeding requiring transfusion should occur very rarely, transfusion rates around 4%.

<h3>Perforation of the Prostatic Capsule</h3> 

<p>A too deep resection can result in perforation of the prostate capsule. Extravasation of the irrigation fluid causes nausea, vomiting, tense abdomen, <a href="https://www.urology-textbook.com/abdominal-pain.html">lower abdomen and back pain</a> despite intraoperative spinal anesthesia. The development of a TUR syndrome is likely (see below). </p>

<h3>TUR Syndrome</h3> 

<p>The intrusion of salt-free irrigation fluid in open veins or perforation of the prostate capsule can cause a volume overload and dilutional hyponatremia (&lt;125 mmol/l) of the patient.</p>

<h4>Signs and symptoms of the TUR syndrome:</h4> <p>Signs and symptoms of a TUR syndrome are confusion, nausea and vomiting, arterial hypertension, bradycardia, pulmonary edema and impaired vision. Risk factors for a TUR syndrome are a prostate volume over 45 ml, resection time over 90 min, height of the irrigation fluid by the patient over 70 cm. </p>

<h4>Diagnosis and therapy of the TUR syndrome:</h4> 
<p>Early detection of the TUR syndrome is possible with <a href="https://www.urology-textbook.com/sodium-serum-blood-test.html">intraoperative sodium controls</a> (venous blood gas analysis). In case of clinical suspicion of a TUR syndrome, furosemide is given (20&ndash;40&nbsp;mg i.v.). It is important to quickly end the operation and to reduce the height of the irrigation fluid by the patient during coagulation. With proven hyponatremia, additionally hypertonic NaCl solution is infused slowly. Depending on the severity of the TUR syndrome, intensive care monitoring is necessary.</p>

<h3>Injury to Adjacent Organs</h3> 

<ul>
<li>Injury to the external sphincter of the bladder resulting in <a href="https://www.urology-textbook.com/male-stress-urinary-incontinence.html">stress urinary incontinence</a></li>
<li>Excessive resection at six o'clock, especially with a large middle lobe, can result in undermining of the bladder neck </li>
<li>Injury to the trigone of the bladder and ureter ostium</li>
<li>Very rarely perforation into the rectum</li>
</ul><h2>Postoperative Complications of TURP</h2>

<h3>Retrograde Ejaculation</h3>

<p>Retrograde Ejaculation occurs in 60&ndash;90% after transurethral resection of the prostate.</p>

<h3>Urinary Tract Infections</h3> 

<p>The cause for postoperative <a href="https://www.urology-textbook.com/urinary-tract-infection.html">urinary tract infections</a> is not only an ascending catheter infection, but also the (already existing) bacterial colonization of the prostate. A perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis reduces the likelihood of infectious complications. An <a href="https://www.urology-textbook.com/epididymitis.html">epididymitis</a> occurs in 2%.</p>

<h3>Micturition</h3> 

<p>Urinary incontinence (up to 10%), mostly mild and self limiting. <a href="https://www.urology-textbook.com/urinary-retention.html">Persistent urinary retention</a>, 2.5% are discharged from the hospital with catheter.</p>

<h3>Bladder Neck Stricture</h3> 

<p>Bladder Neck Stricture in 2&ndash;10%. Risk factors are a prostate volume, missing incision of the bladder neck, blood transfusions and poor micturition after resection. </p>
